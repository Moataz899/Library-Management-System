# Project Description:
This project is a **Library Management System** developed in Python, following the principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. It allows the management of a library's operations, including adding and removing books, handling user accounts, and tracking borrowed and returned books. The system is structured around two main user types: **Librarians** and **Members**, each with specific functionalities.

## Key Features:
- **User Registration & Authentication**: New users can sign up as librarians or members, and sign in to access the system.
- **Book Management**: Librarians can add or remove books from the library catalog.
- **Member Management**: Librarians can register and manage library members.
- **Book Borrowing/Returning**: Members can borrow books, return them, and view their borrowing history.
- **Book Availability**: Tracks which books are currently available or borrowed.
- **Search Functionality**: Members can search for books by title or author.

## Structure:
- **Librarians**: Can manage books, members, and view lists of available and borrowed books.
- **Members**: Can borrow and return books, view their own borrowed books, and search for available books.

## Usage:
1. **Sign Up**: New users must first register as either a librarian or a member.
2. **Sign In**: Registered users can sign in using their credentials.
3. **Librarian Actions**: After signing in, librarians can add/remove books, add/remove members, and view all members and books.
4. **Member Actions**: Members can borrow and return books, search for books, and view their borrowing history.

## How to Run:
To run the system, execute the main script. The user will be prompted to sign up or sign in. Depending on the role, they can perform the respective actions available to librarians or members.
